This exercise aims to deepen your understanding of ANNs and the significant role hyperparameter tuning plays in enhancing model performance.\n","\n","**Dataset:** Alphabets_data.csv\n","\n","The dataset provided, \"Alphabets_data.csv\", consists of labeled data suitable for a classification task aimed at identifying different alphabets. Before using this data in your model, you'll need to preprocess it to ensure optimal performance.\n","\n","**Tasks**\n","\n","Task 1: Data Exploration and Preprocessing\n","\n","1) Begin by loading and exploring the \"Alphabets_data.csv\" dataset. Summarize its key features such as the number of samples, features, and classes.\n","\n","2) Execute necessary data preprocessing steps including data normalization, managing missing values.\n","\n","Task 2: Model Implementation\n","\n","1) Construct a basic ANN model using your chosen high-level neural network library. Ensure your model includes at least one hidden layer.\n","\n","2) Divide the dataset into training and test sets.\n","\n","3) Train your model on the training set and then use it to make predictions on the test set.\n","\n","Task 3: Hyperparameter Tuning\n","\n","1) Modify various hyperparameters, such as the number of hidden layers, neurons per hidden layer, activation functions, and learning rate, to observe their impact on model performance.\n","\n","2) Adopt a structured approach like grid search or random search for hyperparameter tuning, documenting your methodology thoroughly.\n","\n","Task 4: Evaluation\n","\n","1) Employ suitable metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate your model's performance.\n","\n","2) Discuss the performance differences between the model with default hyperparameters and the tuned model, emphasizing the effects of hyperparameter tuning.\n","\n","**Evaluation Criteria**\n","\n","Accuracy and completeness of the implementation.\n","\n","Proficiency in data preprocessing and model development.\n","\n","Systematic approach and thoroughness in hyperparameter tuning.\n","\n","Depth of evaluation and discussion.\n","\n","Overall quality of the report.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"_2_x_nga1TjV"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**Task 1: Data Exploration and Preprocessing**\n","\n","1) Begin by loading and exploring the \"Alphabets_data.csv\" dataset.
